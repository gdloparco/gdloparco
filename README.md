### About Me ‚úåÔ∏è

</br>

Transitioning from a successful career in ***Operations***, which has instilled in me a deep understanding of process optimization and data-driven decision-making, I have recently completed my journey with ***Makers Academy*** - one of Europe's leading bootcamps for software development. At Makers, I've enhanced my skills in compiled languages such as ***Golang*** and ***Java***, solidifying my expertise in ***TDD***, data structures, containerisation and concurrency. Moreover, interpreted languages like ***Python*** and ***JavaScript*** have empowered me to tackle full-stack development challenges, integrating ***databases*** and leveraging ***cloud services***. With a passion for ***continuous learning*** and ***agile methodologies***, I am eager to apply my technical competence and operational expertise to drive positive change in the tech industry.
